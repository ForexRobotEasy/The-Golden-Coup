## Overview

The Golden Coup EA is designed to perform market analysis and execute trades based on predefined trading rules and strategies. It aims to generate high returns with low risk in the forex market. The code provided here demonstrates how the EA functions in a simplified manner.

## Code Explanation

### Libraries and Constants

The code begins by including the necessary libraries, such as Trade.mqh and ArrayObj.mqh. It also defines a constant variable `DRAWDOWN_LIMIT` which represents the maximum allowed drawdown.

### Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is the expert advisor's initialization function. It is called once when the EA is attached to a chart. In this function, trade parameters are initialized and the EA connects to the trading account. Parameters such as expert magic number, stop loss, take profit, slippage, trade timeout, trade retry count, and drawdown limit are set.

### Start Function

The `OnStart()` function is the expert advisor's start function. It is called on each tick of the chart. In this function, market analysis is performed by retrieving the current price and the previous price. The trading direction is determined based on the price movement. If the current price is higher than the previous price, the trade direction is set to buy, otherwise it is set to sell.

The function then checks if the drawdown limit has been exceeded. If the current drawdown is equal to or greater than the drawdown limit, no trades will be executed, and a message will be printed.

If the drawdown limit is not exceeded, the function executes a trade based on the predefined trading rules and strategies. If the trade direction is set to buy, a buy trade is executed with a volume of 0.1. If the trade direction is set to sell, a sell trade is executed with a volume of 0.1.

### Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is the expert advisor's deinitialization function. It is called when the EA is removed from the chart. In this function, any open trades are closed, and the EA disconnects from the trading account.
